# Voice-Classifiaction-Using-Logistic-Regression


* Load the dataset "voice.csv", extract the target variable, and apply one-hot encoding to it. Split the data into a 80-20 train-test split.
* Train a logistic regression model using the training data and evaluate its accuracy on the test set.
* Calculate the correlation matrix of predictors and identify highly correlated predictor pairs. Visualize the correlation matrix using a heatmap.
* Remove one predictor from each highly correlated pair, retrain the logistic regression model, and compare its accuracy with the initial model.
